# Web Scraper for Rotten Tomatoes
Going to scrape through rotten tomatoes (RT) and analyze their reviews.

## Hypothesis
I don't think RT's reviews follow a normal distribution. They should. It seems like
IMDB has a much better distribution.

## The next hard things to do
* Get a list of movie titles on RT, they don't seem to be as simple as I'd like.
* Iterate through and pull down film ratings, analyze them
* Do this many times through; check if ratings are normally distributed

## Stuff to use, maybe
* SQLite
* Bloom Filter - might be overkill
